      <h2 class="mt-5">Origin of the name of Botosani City</h2>
      <p>The name of the city probably has its origin in the name of a boyar family called Botaș, whose 
      name can be found in old records from the time of Prince Stephen the Great (late 15th century) 
      as one of the most important families of Moldavia, records which trace it back to the 11th century.</p>
      <p>Botoșani is first mentioned in 1439, in which one chronicle says that "the Mongols came and 
      pillaged all the way to Botușani". The town is then mentioned only during the conflicts between 
      Moldavia and Poland: several battles were fought near the town, in 1500, 1505 and 1509. During 
      the reign of Petru Rareș, the town was set ablaze by the Poles. It was during his reign then that 
      we know that the town had a hill fort.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Brief History</h2>
      <p>In the 15th century, it was still not a fully-fledged town, but archeological evidence shows that 
      it was a pre-urban settlement. During the second part of the 14th century, some Transylvanian 
      colonists (most likely German or Hungarian) settled in Botoșani. Additionally, a large community 
      of Armenian traders settled in the 14th or 15th centuries.</p>
      <p>At the junction of several commercial roads including the "Moldavian Road", which linked Iași to 
      Hotin, the city was initially a market town. By 1579 it already had "the biggest and the oldest fair 
      of Moldavia".</p>
      <p>A large Jewish community was established in the city during the 17th century, which was the second 
      biggest and most important in Moldavia until the end of the 19th century.</p>
      <p>During World War II, Botoșani was captured on 7 April 1944 by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian 
      Front in the course of the Uman–Botoșani Offensive.</p>
      <p>Some of the most famous Romanian cultural representatives such as Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national 
      poet, and Nicolae Iorga, the famous Romanian historian, were born in Botoșani. Contemporary poet Maria 
      Baciu also hails from Botoșani.</p>
      <p>It is also the location of A.T. Laurian National College, founded in 1859, one of Romania's oldest 
      and most prestigious pre-university educational institutions.</p>
