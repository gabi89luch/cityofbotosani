      <h2 class="mt-5">Days of „Mihai Eminescu”</h2>
      <img src="assests/img/mihai-eminescu.webp" alt="Mihai Eminescu" class="img-thumbnail">
      <p>The "Mihai Eminescu" days are perhaps the most important cultural event that takes place in Botoşani 
        in a year.
        The municipality awards the "Mihai Eminescu" National Award at the beginning of each year, during a 
        special celebration. The winner of the award chosen by a jury made up of personalities of Romanian 
        culture automatically becomes an honorary citizen of the municipality of Botoşani. The award and 
        conferment of the title of honorary citizen are approved by the first Local Council Decision of the 
        year.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Days of the City</h2>
      <img src="assests/img/city-days.jpg" alt="Days of the City" class="img-thumbnail">
      <p>On this occasion, a complex of events is organized in Botoşani, such as: exhibitions, artisans' fair, 
        sports and artistic competitions, dance music concerts dedicated to young people, folklore shows, etc.</p>
      <p>The religious service officiated on the day of Saint George is one of the most important and solemn 
        moments included in the program. Thousands of believers come and pray at the relics of the saints that 
        are brought to Botoşani these days. The courtyard of the "Saint Gheorghe" Church and the surroundings 
        where the service officiated by the High Church Faces takes place become a real place of pilgrimage 
        during this festive period.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Days of „Nicolae Iorga”</h2>
      <img src="assests/img/nicolae-iorga.jpg" alt="Nicolae Iorga" class="img-thumbnail">
      <p>Botoşani City Hall awards every year, during the "Nicolae Iorga" Days, at the proposal of the organizers: 
        "Nicolae Iorga" Cultural Association and the County Directorate for Culture, Cults and National Cultural 
        Heritage, the "Nicolae Iorga" National Award. This aims both to recognize the merits of some established 
        personalities in the field of humanities who over time have been involved in the elaboration of scientific 
        studies on the life and work of the historian Nicolae Iorga, as well as to stimulate the interest of young 
        researchers in the same topic.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">New Year's Eve Festivities</h2>
      <img src="assests/img/new-years-eve.jpg" alt="New Years Eve" class="img-thumbnail">
      <p>Every year in Botoşani, on the last day, there is a New Year's party organized in the form of a show to 
        which well-known bands and artists from the local showbiz are invited. In the opening of the show, local 
        bands and artists sing. Fireworks and champagne are indispensable at this event.</p>
      <p>Botoşani City Hall collaborates on these actions carried out annually in Botoşani with various NGOs,
